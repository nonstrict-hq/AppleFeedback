Created for Apple Feedback to demonstrate that we can't record voice isolation when capturing from a commandline app, but everything works perfectly fine when running this code from a macOS app.


Reply from Apple:

> The Voice Isolation mic mode relies on the user having a bundle ID. It was not designed to handle the CML tool.

Created feature request "Allow Voice Isolation mode for child command line process" FB13684384
